# Lecutre Notes

## Falsey values in JS
- false
- 0 (zero)
- '' (empty string)
- null
- undefined
- NaN

## comparison operators
a == b 'loose equality' the value is the same, but the data type does not need to be. Type coersion/weak typing.

a === b 'strict equality' the value and the data type are the same *exactly the same*

a != b "not/ loosely equal || loosely NOT equal" 10 != "string" will accept diffent types WON'T accept different values

a !== b "strictly NOT equal || NOT strictly equal" - if either is false this is true

a > b a is *greater than* b

a < b a is *less than* b

a >= b a is *greater than or equal to* b

a <= b less than OR equal to

## Logical operators

a && b both a and b evaluate truthy

a || b if either evaluate truthy this is truthy

!a **bang** 'not' *opposite day*

## Arrays
- a datatype of object
- a list of element, can be any datatype
- every elelment in an array has an index location (reference location) wwhere it can be found in the array
- js arrays are zero based
- in JAVASCRIPT arrays can be mixed datatypes but not happily looked upon 

` let pizza = ['yummy', 10, ['pineapple', 'olives']]`

## loops (the best)
### why?
- save us from having to repeat code, and allow ambiguity of # of times

## what?
- a very common pattern
- a block of code that repeats over and over until a condition changes and is no longer true
